    "# Prolog Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog is a logic programming language used in artificial intelligence rooted in first-order logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atom: a general purpose name with no inherent meaning\n",
    "- Numbers: floats or integers\n",
    "- Variables: string consisting of letters, numbers, and underscore characters used for for placeholders of arbitrary terms\n",
    "- Compound Term: a atom functor with arguments as terms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules and Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog models describes relationships by means of clauses to define rules and facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicates are written in the following format `<operator>/<# of inputs>`. The format indicates a `<# of inputs>-arity` operator with name `<operator>`. Common built-in predicates include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `,/2`: Conjunction/Intersection/AND\n",
    "- `;/2`: Disjunction/Union/OR\n",
    "- `\\+/1`: Negation/NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules take the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "Head :- Body.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which reads \"Head is true if Body is true\". A rule's body consists of calls to predicates which are called the rule's goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "Facts take the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "cat(tom).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "cat(tom) :- true.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries are meant to as questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- cat(tom).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which asks `is tom a cat?`\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- cat(X).\n",
    "X = tom\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which asks `what things are cats?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Clauses with rules can be made such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "animal(X) :- cat(X).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then a question that can be asked is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- animal(X)\n",
    "X = tom\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which asks, `what things are animals?`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "First relationships are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "mother_child(trude, sally).\n",
    "\n",
    "father_child(tom, sally).\n",
    "father_child(tom, erica).\n",
    "father_child(mike, tom).\n",
    "\n",
    "sibling(X, Y) :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "parent_child(X, Y) :- father_child(X, Y).\n",
    "parent_child(X, Y) :- mother_child(X, Y).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then one can ask `are sally and erica siblings?`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "?- sibling(sally, erica).\n",
    "Yes\n",

    "# Problog\n",
    "\n",
    "Problog extends Prolog by introducing additional operators `::` and two predicates `query` and `evidence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probabilitc Logic Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Prolog and Problog is that Problog supports probabilistic predicates which is realized by the `::` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```problog\n",
    "0.5::heads.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
